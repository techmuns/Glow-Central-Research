// That is what lets `node scripts/lib/company-index.mjs "Some Company Ltd"` explain a single

//
// WHY THIS IS HARDER THAN IT LOOKS
//   An AMC writes "Prestige Estates Projects Limited". Moneycontrol truncate to about sixteen
//   characters and store "Prestige Estate". Screener writes "Prestige Estates". None of those match
//   as strings, so matching is done on TOKENS with each index token allowed to be a prefix of the
//   query token in the same position.
//
//   That rule alone is too generous in one direction: "Arvind" prefix-matches "Arvind Fashions
//   Limited", and those are two different listed companies. So an index name with FEWER tokens than
//   the query has to show evidence that it was truncated — a token cut mid-word, or a name long
//   enough to have hit the truncation limit. Everything that fails both is left unresolved for a
//   human to put in a CONFIRMED table, because a wrong symbol is far worse than a missing one: it
//   silently gives one company another's numbers.

// Words that carry no identity, dropped before a name is tokenised. `india` / `indian` are
// deliberately NOT here — they distinguish "General Insurance Corporation of India" from a dozen
// other insurers, and "Sirca Paints India" from "Sirca Paints".
const NOISE = new Set(['ltd', 'limited', 'pvt', 'private', 'the', 'and', 'co', 'corp', 'inc', 'plc']);

// Moneycontrol cut a name at about sixteen characters, so a name at least this long may be a
// truncation of something longer. Below it, the name is almost certainly complete.
//
// Twelve rather than sixteen because the tokeniser has already dropped "Ltd" and the spaces:
// "Power Finance" is what survives of "Power Finance Corporation Ltd" and squashes to twelve.
const TRUNCATION_LENGTH = 12;
